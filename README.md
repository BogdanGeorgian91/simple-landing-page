# simple-landing-page
A simple landing page created after a random mockup found on Pinterest. 

It's my first project where I've used SASS and I have to say that i find it very useful. <br>
Also used CSS Grid, Flexbox and Media Queries to make it responsive. <br>
I've also learned about the BEM methodology but I was lazy to remake the classes and everything but I'm planning to use it from now on. <br>
Used a bit of JavaScript for the burger menu. <br>
And I almost forgot, I also started using NPM. <br>
